Today, I worked on:

Applied the floating square template to all forms in Plants, Gardens, Journals, and Identify My Plant. Updated every Delete button so that all buttons are uniform and buttons are vertically not horizontally aligned. Added padding to Main Page middle section, changed Problem, Solution, and bottom page title font to Work's Sans. Moved Login and Sign Up to right side of Nav Bar.

Tomorrow I'll add some animation and see about creating a uniformed background with similar colors and themes to the form page headers and dropdowns from the headers once you are logged in.
